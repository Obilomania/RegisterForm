# RegisterForm
I needed to build a form for a university portal that i am building with ASP.Net Core, so i decided to practice on VScode first because the auto complete tag makes work faster


building it in Visual studio will take a longer time so i decided to build it in VSCode and then import it to Visual Studio.  It has an Image upload and a password reveal function also. Just a little javascript thats all, nothing special.
